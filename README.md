Create by [@pxcs.](https://github.com/pxcs/) This tool targeted to get information about the versions of software and services running on the network. This information can be used to identify known ```vulnerabilities``` and exploits specific to those versions. Mainly used for enumerate user accounts, group memberships, and roles within a target system. Knowing user privileges and access rights can help ***~Attackers~*** to identify potential targets for privilege escalation.

These tools can help to uncover network policies, firewall rules, and routing tables. Understanding these configurations can help ***~Attackers~*** find ways to bypass security measures. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enumeration can reveal detailed device information, including system configurations, hardware details, and running processes, which can be leveraged for further attacks.<br><br>
